    <h1>Arsenal 2023: A year in review</h1>
    <p>It has been an incredible journey for the club and the fans alike. Since Mikel Arteta’s takeover as Arsenal manager, he has placed the club on an upward trajectory. And this year marked one of the biggest leaps the north London side has made.

Arteta’s side narrowly missed out on the Premier League title, but they returned to the Champions League for the first time since the 2016/17 season. While Manchester City would eventually pip them to the crown, Arsenal's initial tempest saw them make their best-ever start to a Premier League season by taking 50 points from their first 19 games. They also stayed at the top of the table for 248 days.</p>
    <p>If only William Saliba hadn't hurt his back at Fulham, eh?

    It simply proves what a rollercoaster the first half of 2023 simply was – a lot of highs and lows. However, many fans recognised the fact that the season was still a massive step forward for the Gunners. No one expected them to compete for the title, yet they came ever so close to usurping an all-time great outfit.</p>
    <h2>Aggressive in the transfer market</h2>
    <p>Along with Rice, Jurrien Timber, Kai Havertz and David Raya were also brought in. Timber picked up an ACL injury before he could prove his worth to the club. However, he demonstrated considerable potential in pre-season.

    Earlier in January, Leandro Trossard, Jakub Kiwior and Jorginho were also signed. Trossard, in particular, played a key role in maintaining Arsenal's title charge.<p/>
    <h3>The issue of squad depth</h3>
    <p>A significant issue that Arsenal are yet to resolve is squad depth. The club's title charge faltered due to key injuries and the lack of quality on the fringes of Mikel Arteta's squad. Saliba seemed to be the link that needed to be broken for Arsenal to stutter in the title race. Following his injury in March, the team could not replace his presence and eventually, it cost them.

    Arteta understandably loves a versatile player, it enables a broader range of options. Despite the signings made in the summer, the north London side lack the like-for-like alternatives. Arteta learnt the hard way last season how badly lack of depth can affect a squad and must seek to improve on this end.</p>
